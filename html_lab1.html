    <h1><em> Before Highschool </em></h1>

    <p> My name is Shakira Medina and I am a Senior in Bronx Early College Academy. Before high school I attended MottHall3 middle school. When I knew I would be attending BECA I honestly didnt know what to feel because at that time I only knew one person who was already in this school. I was neutral because even though I wanted to leave everyone and everything from middle school behind, I knew it would be weird to meet new people that were already together in middle school and were moving up to highschool together. </p>
   
     
    <h2><em> During highschool </em></h2>
    <p> When I came into BECA freshman year I immediately met my friendgroup who recieved me with open arms even if most of them already were together before. During lunch we would share about eachother and talk about what we wanted to do in the future. When COVID hit we continued to stay in contact and help eachother because we knew we were under a lot of stress because of remote learning. </p>

    <h3><em> Senior Year/ After HS </em></h3>
    <p> Now that I am a senior I was given the opportunity to be in a class where I can recieve annother diploma on top of my IB and high school diploma. during this year I will be learnig about responsibilities I will have after I graduate and will be mostly focused on getting everything ready for college. After graduating I will be studying health sciences to become a physcial therapist, as to where and which college I will be attending, I dont know yet.</p>

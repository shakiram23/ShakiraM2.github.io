<p> <h3> Project Statement:</h3></p>
<p> I made this project by writing 6 words that describe my aesthetic. I used adobe express to create a collage that visually represents my aesthetic. I started by searching up images of each word I chose and picked out the ones that matched each other well. I chose pictures that had a darker look to them but also relaxing. I think my collage matches my aesthetic because it represents things that are calming and relaxing to me and also images that represent my overall personality. The point of this project was to combine different images into one place and make the product show a version of your aesthetic.</p>

 <p><h3> Project Statement: </h3></p>
<p> My social justice topic is masculinity norms and how they affect today's males. I chose this
because it's a topic that isn't spoken about much and I wanted to choose something that
others wouldn't normally find interesting enough to speak on. This is important to me
because my friends and I have had conversations about this topic and I've seen their point
of view on how they feel when they are treated in a way that forces them into social norms.
I believe that an important piece of information that people should know about this topic is
that teenage men are being mentally and physically unstable because of the pressure put
into them to have to fit into what men are “supposed” to look like and act.<p>

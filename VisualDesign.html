<p><h3> Project Image: </h3></p>

<p> <h3> Project Statement:</h3></p>
<p> I made this project by writing 6 words that describe my aesthetic. I used adobe express to create a collage that visually represents my aesthetic. I started by searching up images of each word I chose and picked out the ones that matched each other well. I chose pictures that had a darker look to them but also relaxing. I think my collage matches my aesthetic because it represents things that are calming and relaxing to me and also images that represent my overall personality. The point of this project was to combine different images into one place and make the product show a version of your aesthetic.</p>

 <p><h3> Project Statement: </h3></p>
<p> My social justice topic is masculinity norms and how they affect today's males. I chose this
because it's a topic that isn't spoken about much and I wanted to choose something that
others wouldn't normally find interesting enough to speak on. This is important to me
because my friends and I have had conversations about this topic and I've seen their point
of view on how they feel when they are treated in a way that forces them into social norms.
I believe that an important piece of information that people should know about this topic is
that teenage men are being mentally and physically unstable because of the pressure put
into them to have to fit into what men are “supposed” to look like and act.<p>

 <p><h3> Project Statement: </h3></p>
<p> This project was created repeating most of the steps. I first
began with choosing a custom shape tool that I will be using
throughout the entire project. I decided on a flower. After taking
the shape, rotating it and rotating it, it was time to merge my
layers.I then duplicated the new layers and rotated it again. I
basically followed this process about 5 times and it started to
create the mandala. I was told that I needed to choose colors for
this project so I chose red and black to go with my flowers.<p>

 <p><h3> Project Statement: </h3></p>
<p> The aim for this project was to choose an image of a celebrity and with that image you
had to change the coloring and quality to have a final image that represents pop art. After
downloading the image and opening it in photoshop, I utilized the quick selection tool to
isolate the subject from the background. Then I used the image threshold to lighten the
image in order to see certain features. The complete change in color happened when I
merged the layers and used the eyedropper tool for the black sections and the color
picker for the lighter parts of the image. Overall I chose this celebrity because he is my
favorite celebrity and as for the picture, I felt as if this picture shows plenty of details and
I decided to use that to my advantage.<p>

 <p><h3> Project Statement: </h3></p>
<p> I used Adobe Photoshop to create this project. I started by creating the character's base which was the body and after creating the whole character I went onto the background. My character has the body of Captain America and the head of Stitch. He is wearing the marvel superhero costume and the background is the beach since he is part stitch. The video game my character would be a part of would be some type of tropical island video game where there are villains trying to destroy the island. The purpose of my character would be that he will end up saving the island.</p>

<p> <h3> Project Statement:</h3></p>
<p> I made this project by writing 6 words that describe my aesthetic. I used adobe express to create a collage that visually represents my aesthetic. I started by searching up images of each word I chose and picked out the ones that matched each other well. I chose pictures that had a darker look to them but also relaxing. I think my collage matches my aesthetic because it represents things that are calming and relaxing to me and also images that represent my overall personality. The point of this project was to combine different images into one place and make the product show a version of your aesthetic.</p>
